# Unregister-SPOHubSite

## SYNOPSIS
Disables the hub site feature on a site.

## SYNTAX

```
Unregister-SPOHubSite [-Identity] <SpoHubSitePipeBind>

Disables the hub site feature on a site so that it is no longer a hub site. Associated sites may still appear associated for up to an hour. If you want to speed up the process, use the Remove-SPOHubSiteAssociation cmdlet to remove the associates sites first.
