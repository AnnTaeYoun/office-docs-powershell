# New-Mailbox

This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other. 
  
Use the **New-Mailbox** cmdlet to create mailboxes and user accounts at the same time.
  
For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx). 
  
```
New-Mailbox -Password <SecureString> -UserPrincipalName <String> [-ArbitrationMailbox <MailboxIdParameter>] [-InactiveMailbox <MailboxIdParameter>] [-MailboxPlan <MailboxPlanIdParameter>] [-ModeratedBy <MultiValuedProperty>] [-ModerationEnabled <$true | $false>] [-RemovedMailbox <RemovedMailboxIdParameter>] [-SendModerationNotifications <Never | Internal | Always>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

```

## Examples
<a name="Examples"> </a>

### Example 1

This example creates a user Chris Ashton in Active Directory and creates a mailbox for the user. The mailbox is located on Mailbox Database 1. The password must be reset at the next logon. To set the initial value of the password, this example creates a variable ( _$password_), prompts you to enter a password, and assigns that password to the variable as a **SecureString** object.
  
```
$password = Read-Host "Enter password" -AsSecureString; New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName chris@contoso.com -Alias chris -Database "Mailbox Database 1" -Name ChrisAshton -OrganizationalUnit Users -Password $password -FirstName Chris -LastName Ashton -DisplayName "Chris Ashton" -ResetPasswordOnNextLogon $true
```

### Example 2

This example creates a user in Active Directory and a resource mailbox for a conference room. The resource mailbox is located in Mailbox Database 1. The password must be reset at the next logon. You are prompted for the value of the initial password because it's not specified.
  
```
New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName confmbx@contoso.com -Alias confmbx -Name ConfRoomMailbox -Database "Mailbox Database 1" -OrganizationalUnit Users -Room -ResetPasswordOnNextLogon $true
```

### Example 3

This example creates an enabled user account in Active Directory and a room mailbox for a conference room in an on-premises Exchange organization. The  _RoomMailboxPassword_ parameter specifies the password for the user account.
  
```
New-Mailbox -UserPrincipalName confroom1010@contoso.com -Alias confroom1010 -Name "Conference Room 1010" -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String P@ssw0rd -AsPlainText -Force)
```

### Example 4

This example creates the shared mailbox "Sales Department" and grants  _Full Access_ and _Send on Behalf_ permissions for the security group "MarketingSG". Users who are members of the security group will be granted the permissions to the mailbox.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This example assumes that you've already created a mail-enabled security group named "MarketingSG" by using the **New-DistributionGroup** cmdlet.
  
```
New-Mailbox -Shared -Name "Sales Department" -DisplayName "Sales Department" -Alias Sales; Set-Mailbox -Identity Sales -GrantSendOnBehalfTo MarketingSG; Add-MailboxPermission -Identity Sales -User MarketingSG -AccessRights FullAccess -InheritanceType All
```

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _AccountDisabled_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _AccountDisabled_ switch specifies that the user account associated with the mailbox is disabled. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> The mailbox is created, and the associated account is created, but the account is disabled, so you can't log on to the mailbox.  <br/> |
| _Arbitration_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _Arbitration_ parameter specifies that the mailbox for which you are executing the command is an arbitration mailbox. Arbitration mailboxes are used for managing approval workflow. For example, an arbitration mailbox is used for handling moderated recipients and distribution group membership approval. <br/> |
| _ArchiveDomain_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.SmtpDomain  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _ArchiveDomain_ parameter specifies the domain in the cloud-based service where the archive that's associated with this mailbox exists. For example, if the SMTP email address of the user is tony@contoso.com, the SMTP domain could be archive.contoso.com. <br/> > [!NOTE]> Only use this parameter if the archive is hosted in the cloud-based service.           |
| _AuditLog_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _AuxAuditLog_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _Discovery_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Discovery_switch specifies that the mailbox is a Discovery mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.  <br/> This switch is required only if you're creating a Discovery mailbox.  <br/> Discovery mailboxes are created as target mailboxes for Discovery searches. After being created or enabled, a Discovery mailbox can't be repurposed or converted to another type of mailbox. For more information, see [In-Place eDiscovery](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/6377cb7a-3416-4e15-8571-c45d2160fc6f.aspx).  <br/> |
| _EnableRoomMailboxAccount_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _EnableRoomMailboxAccount_ parameter specifies whether to enable the disabled user account that's associated with this room mailbox. Valid values are: <br/>  `$true`: The disabled account that's associated with the room mailbox is enabled. You also need to use the  _RoomMailboxPassword_ with this value. This allows the account to log on to the room mailbox. <br/>  `$false`: The account that's associated with the room mailbox is disabled. You can't use the account to logon to the room mailbox. This is the default value.  <br/>  You need to use this parameter with the _Room_ switch. <br/>  Typically, the account that's associated with a room mailbox is disabled. However, you need to enable the account for features like the Lync Room System or the Skype for Business Room System. <br/>  In Exchange Online, a room mailbox with an associated enabled account doesn't require a license. <br/> |
| _Equipment_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Equipment_ switch specifies that the resource mailbox is an equipment mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/>  This switch is required only if you're creating an equipment mailbox. <br/> |
| _FederatedIdentity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _FederatedIdentity_ parameter associates an on-premises Active Directory user with a user in the cloud. <br/> |
| _ImportLiveId_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _ImportLiveID_ switch specifies whether to import an unmanaged Microsoft account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID) into the cloud-based domain. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> An unmanaged Microsoft account was created in the domain before the domain was enrolled in the cloud-based service. Importing a Microsoft account into the domain lets you save any settings associated with the Microsoft account, like instant messaging contacts. However, the Microsoft account is now subject to the security and privacy policies of the organization.  <br/> |
| _LinkedDomainController_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _LinkedDomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller in the forest where the user account resides, if the mailbox is a linked mailbox. The domain controller in the forest where the user account resides is used to get security information for the account specified by the _LinkedMasterAccount_ parameter. Use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain controller that you want to use as the value for this parameter. <br/> This parameter is required only if you're creating a linked mailbox.  <br/> |
| _LinkedMasterAccount_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.UserIdParameter  <br/> | The _LinkedMasterAccount_ parameter specifies the master account in the forest where the user account resides, if the mailbox is a linked mailbox. The master account is the account that the mailbox is linked to. The master account grants access to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the master account. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _LinkedRoom_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _LinkedRoom_ switch specifies that the mailbox is a linked resource mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> A linked resource mailbox is useful in a scenario where you have an account in an authentication forest and you want it to be directly linked to a resource mailbox in resource forest.  <br/> |
| _MicrosoftOnlineServicesID_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.WindowsLiveId  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _MicrosoftOnlineServicesID_ parameter specifies the user ID for the object. This parameter only applies to objects in the cloud-based service. It isn't available for on-premises deployments. <br/> |
| _Migration_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Migration_ switch specifies that the mailbox is a migration mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/>  This switch is required only if you're creating a migration mailbox. <br/> |
| _Name_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Name_ parameter specifies the unique name of the mailbox. The maximum length is 64 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("). <br/> |
| _Password_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Security.SecureString  <br/> |The  _Password_ parameter specifies the password for the mailbox (the user account that's associated with the mailbox). This parameter isn't required if you're creating a linked mailbox, resource mailbox, or shared mailbox, because the associated user accounts are disabled for these types of mailboxes. <br/> This parameter uses the syntax  `(ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<password>' -AsPlainText -Force)`. Or, to be prompted to enter the password and store it as a variable, run the command  `$password = Read-Host "Enter password" -AsSecureString`, and then use the value  `$password` for this parameter. <br/> |
| _PublicFolder_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _PublicFolder_ switch specifies that the mailbox is a public folder mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/>  This switch is required only if you're creating a public folder mailbox. <br/> Public folder mailboxes are specially designed mailboxes that store the hierarchy and content of public folders. The first public folder mailbox created in your Exchange organization is called the primary hierarchy mailbox. It contains the writeable copy of the hierarchy of public folders for the organization and public folder content. There can be only one writeable copy of the public folder hierarchy in your organization. All other public folder mailboxes are called secondary public folder mailboxes and contain a read-only copy of the hierarchy and the content for public folders. <br/> |
| _Room_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Room_ switch specifies that the resource mailbox is a room mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/>  This switch is required only if you're creating a room mailbox. <br/> When you use this switch, a logon-disabled account is created with the room mailbox, which prevents users from signing in to the mailbox. When you use the  _EnableRoomMailboxAccount_ and _RoomMailboxPassword_ parameters, you can mail-enable the associated account. <br/> |
| _Scheduling_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use. <br/> |
| _Shared_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Shared_ parameter specifies that the mailbox is a shared mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/>  This switch is required only if you're creating a shared mailbox. <br/> A shared mailbox is a mailbox where multiple users can log on to access the mailbox contents. The mailbox isn't associated with any of the users that can log on. It's associated with a disabled user account.  <br/> |
| _SupervisoryReviewPolicy_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: SwitchParameter  <br/> |
| _UseExistingLiveId_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _UseExistingLiveId_ switch specifies whether to use the specified Microsoft account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID) that already exists in the cloud-based domain. The specified Microsoft account can't have a mail user associated with it. <br/> You don't need to specify a value with this switch.  <br/> |
| _UserPrincipalName_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _UserPrincipalName_ parameter specifies the logon name for the user account. The UPN uses an email address format _\<username\>_@ _\<domain\>_. Typically, the  _\<domain\>_ value is the domain where the user account resides. <br/> |
| _WindowsLiveID_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.WindowsLiveId  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _WindowsLiveID_ parameter specifies the Microsoft account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID) of the mailbox. <br/> |
| _ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxPolicyIdParameter  <br/> | The _ActiveSyncMailboxPolicy_ parameter specifies the mobile device mailbox policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the policy. For example:. <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  If you don't use this parameter, the default mobile device mailbox policy is used. <br/> |
| _AddressBookPolicy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.AddressBookMailboxPolicyIdParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/>  The _AddressBookPolicy_ parameter specifies the address book policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the address book policy. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  For more information about address book policies, see[Address book policies in Exchange 2016](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh529948.aspx).  <br/> |
| _Alias_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> | The _Alias_ parameter specifies the Exchange alias (also known as themail nickname) for the recipient. This value identifies the recipient as a mail-enabled object, and shouldn't be confused with multiple email addresses for the same recipient (also known as proxy addresses). A recipient can have only one  _Alias_ value. <br/>  The value of _Alias_ can contain letters, numbers and the characters !, #, $, %, &amp;, ', *, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, _, `, {, |, } and ~. Periods (.) are allowed, but each period must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, `help.desk`). Unicode characters from U+00A1 to U+00FF are also allowed. The maximum length of the  _Alias_ value is 64 characters. <br/>  When you create a recipient without specifying an email address, the _Alias_ value you specify is used to generate the primary email address ( _\<alias\>_@ _\<domain\>_). Supported Unicode characters are mapped to best-fit US-ASCII text characters. For example, U+00F6 (ö) is changed to oe in the primary email address.  <br/>  If you don't use the _Alias_ parameter when you create a recipient, the value of a different required parameter is used for the **Alias** property value: <br/> **Recipients with user accounts (for example, user mailboxes, and mail users)**: The left side of the  _MicrosoftOnlineServicesID_ or _UserPrincipalName_ parameter is used. For example, `helpdesk@contoso.com` results in the **Alias** property value `helpdesk`.  <br/> **Recipeints without user accounts (for example, room mailboxes, mail contacts, and distribution groups)**: The value of the  _Name_ parameter is used. Spaces are removed and unsupported characters are converted to question marks (?). <br/>  If you modify the _Alias_ value of an existing recipient, the primary email address is automatically updated only in on-premises environments where the recipient is subject to email address policies (the **EmailAddressPolicyEnabled** property is `True` for the recipient). <br/> > [!NOTE]>  The _Alias_ parameter never generates or updates the primary email address of a mail contact or a mail user.          |
| _ArbitrationMailbox_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxIdParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/>  The _ArbitrationMailbox_ parameter specifies the arbitration mailbox that's used to manage the moderation process for this recipient. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the arbitration mailbox. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  _\<domain name\>_\ _\<account name\>_ <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> **LegacyExchangeDN** <br/> **SamAccountName** <br/>  User ID or user principal name (UPN) <br/> |
| _Archive_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Archive_switch specifies that an archive mailbox is created for this mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.  <br/> |
| _ArchiveDatabase_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.DatabaseIdParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/>  The _ArchiveDatabase_ parameter specifies the Exchange database that contains the archive that's associated with this mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _Database_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.DatabaseIdParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/>  The _Database_ parameter specifies the mailbox database that contains the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the database. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  Use the **Get-MailboxDatabase** cmdlet to see the available mailbox databases. <br/> |
| _DisplayName_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _DisplayName_ parameter specifies the display name of the mailbox. The display name is visible in the Exchange admin center, in address lists, and in Outlook. The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("). <br/> If you don't use the  _DisplayName_ parameter, the value of the _Name_ parameter is used for the display name. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _EvictLiveId_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _EvictLiveId_ switch specifies whether to remove an unmanaged Microsoft account (formerly known as a Windows Live ID) from the cloud-based domain. An unmanaged Microsoft account was created in the domain before the domain was enrolled in the cloud-based service. Evicting a Microsoft account from the domain lets you save any settings associated with the Microsoft account, like instant messaging contacts. <br/> You don't need to specify a value with this switch.  <br/> |
| _FirstName_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _FirstName_ parameter specifies the user's first name. <br/> |
| _Force_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _Force_ switch specifies whether to suppress warning or confirmation messages. You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
| _HoldForMigration_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _HoldForMigration_ switch specifies whether to prevent any client or user, except the Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Replication service (MRS) process, from logging on to a public folder mailbox. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> You need to use this parameter when you create the first public folder, which is called the hierarchy mailbox, in your organization.  <br/> > [!CAUTION]> Use this parameter only if you plan to migrate legacy Exchange 2010 public folders to Exchange 2016. If you use this switch but don't have legacy public folders to migrate, you won't be able to create any public folders.           |
| _ImmutableId_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _ImmutableId_ parameter is used by GAL synchronization (GALSync) and specifies a unique and immutable identifier in the form of an SMTP address for an Exchange mailbox used for federated delegation when requesting Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens. If federation is configured for this mailbox and you don't set this parameter when you create the mailbox, Exchange creates the value for the immutable ID based upon the mailbox's **ExchangeGUID** and the federated account namespace, for example, 7a78e7c8-620e-4d85-99d3-c90d90f29699@mail.contoso.com. <br/> You need to set the  _ImmutableId_ parameter if Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is deployed to allow single sign-on into an off-premises mailbox and AD FS is configured to use a different attribute than **ExchangeGUID** for sign-on token requests. Both, Exchange and AD FS must request the same token for the same user to ensure proper functionality for a cross-premises Exchange deployment scenario. <br/> |
| _InactiveMailbox_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxIdParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service.  <br/> The  _InactiveMailbox_parameter specifies the inactive mailbox that you want to recover. To find inactive mailboxes, run the command  `Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly | FL Name,PrimarySmtpAddress,DistinguishedName,ExchangeGuid` and then use the **DistinguishedName** or **ExchangeGuid** property values to identify the inactive mailbox for this parameter (values guaranteed to be unique). <br/> |
| _Initials_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Initials_ parameter specifies the user's middle initials. <br/> |
| _IsExcludedFromServingHierarchy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The  _IsExcludedFromServingHierarchy_ parameter prevents users from accessing the public folder hierarchy on this public folder mailbox. For load-balancing purposes, users are equally distributed across public folder mailboxes by default. When this parameter is set on a public folder mailbox, that mailbox isn't included in this automatic load-balancing and won't be accessed by users to retrieve the public folder hierarchy. However, if an administrator has set the _DefaultPublicFolderMailbox_ property on a user mailbox to a specific public folder mailbox, the user will still access the specified public folder mailbox even if the _IsExcludedFromServingHierarchy_ parameter is set for that public folder mailbox. <br/> |
| _LastName_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _LastName_ parameter specifies the user's last name. <br/> |
| _LinkedCredential_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.PSCredential  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _LinkedCredential_ parameter specifies credentials to use to access the domain controller specified by the _LinkedDomainController_ parameter. This parameter is optional, even if you're enabling a linked mailbox. <br/> This parameter requires you to create a credentials object by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet. For more information, see[Get-Credential](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=142122).  <br/> |
| _MailboxPlan_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxPlanIdParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in the cloud-based service. <br/>  The _MailboxPlan_ parameter specifies the mailbox plan to applytothe mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox plan. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Display name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  A mailbox plan specifies the permissions and features that are available to a mailbox. In Office 365, mailbox plans correspond to the subscriptions and licenses that administrators purchase and assign in the Office 365 admin center. <br/>  You can see the available mailbox plans by using the **Get-MailboxPlan** cmdlet. <br/> |
| _MailboxProvisioningConstraint_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Directory.MailboxProvisioningConstraint  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _MailboxProvisioningPreferences_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MultiValuedProperty  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _MailboxRegion_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ModeratedBy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MultiValuedProperty  <br/> | The _ModeratedBy_ parameter specifies one or more moderators for this recipient. A moderator approves messages sent to the recipient before the messages are delivered. A moderator must be a mailbox, mail user, or mail contact in your organization. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the moderator. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/>  To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>...`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax:  `"<value1>","<value2>"...`.  <br/>  To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: `@{Add="<value1>","<value2>"...; Remove="<value1>","<value2>"...}`.  <br/>  You need to use this parameter to specify at least one moderator when you set the _ModerationEnabled_ parameter to the value `$true`.  <br/> |
| _ModerationEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _ModerationEnabled_ parameter specifies whether moderation is enabled for this recipient. Valid value are: <br/>  `$true`: Moderation is enabled for this recipient. Messages sent to this recipient must be approved by a moderator before the messages are delivered.  <br/>  `$false`: Moderation is disabled for this recipient. Messages sent to this recipient are delivered without the approval of a moderator. This is the default value.  <br/>  You use the _ModeratedBy_ parameter to specify the moderators. <br/> |
| _Office_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Office_ parameter specifies the user's physical office name or number. <br/> |
| _OfficeGraph_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _OrganizationalUnit_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.OrganizationalUnitIdParameter  <br/> | The _OrganizationalUnit_ parameter specifies the location in Active Directory where the new mailbox is created. <br/>  Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the **Get-OrganizationalUnit** cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Canonical name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/> |

For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished Name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  Retention policies consist of tags that are applied to mailbox folders and mail items to determine the period of time that the items should be retained. <br/>  Use the **Get-RetentionPolicy** cmdlet to see the available retention policies. <br/>  If you don't use this parameter, the retention policy named Default MRM Policy is applied to the mailbox. <br/> |
| _RoleAssignmentPolicy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxPolicyIdParameter  <br/> | The _RoleAssignmentPolicy_ parameter specifies the role assignment policy that's applied to the mailbox. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the role assignment policy. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  In Office 365, if you don't use this parameter, the default role assignment policy named Default Role Assignment Policy is automatically applied to the mailbox. In on-premises Exchange, no role assignment policy is automatically applied to the mailbox. <br/>  Use the **Get-RoleAssignmentPolicy** cmdlet to see the available role assignment policies. For more information about assignment policies, see[Understanding Management Role Assignment Policies](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/25913e43-326a-4371-90b5-021a35f100fe.aspx).  <br/> |
| _RoomMailboxPassword_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Security.SecureString  <br/> | Use the _RoomMailboxPassword_ parameter to configure the password for a room mailbox that has a logon-enabled account (the _EnableRoomMailboxAccount_ parameter is set to the value `$true`.)  <br/>  To use this parameter, you need to be a member of one of the following role groups: <br/>  Office 365: The Organization Management role group via the Mail Recipients, Reset Password, and User Options roles, the Help Desk role group via the Reset Password and User Options roles, or the Recipient Management role group via the Mail Recipients and Reset Password roles. <br/>  On-premises Exchange: The Organization Management role group via the Mail Recipients and User Options roles, the Recipient Management role group via the Mail Recipients role, or the Help Desk role group via the User Options role. The Reset Password role also allows you to use this parameter, but it isn't assigned to any role groups by default. <br/>  This parameter uses the syntax `(ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<password>' -AsPlainText -Force)`. Or, to be prompted to enter the password and store it as a variable, run the command  `$password = Read-Host "Enter password" -AsSecureString`, and then use the value  `$password` for this parameter. <br/> |
| _SamAccountName_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _SamAccountName_ parameter (also known as the pre-Windows 2000 user account or group name) specifies an object identifier that's compatible with older versions of Microsoft Windows client and server operating systems. The value can contain letters, numbers, spaces, periods (.), and the characters !, #, $, %, ^, &amp;, -, _, {, }, and ~. The last character can't be a period.
