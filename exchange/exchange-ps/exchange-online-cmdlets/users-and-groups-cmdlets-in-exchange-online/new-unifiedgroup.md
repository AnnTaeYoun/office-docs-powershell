Office 365 groups are group objects that are available across Office 365 services. 
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx). 
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _DlIdentity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.DistributionGroupIdParameter  <br/> | The _DlIdentity_ parameter specifies the distribution group (also known as a distribution list or DL) that you want to migrate to an Office 365 Group. The distribution group must be a universal distribution group (the **RecipientTypeDetails** property value is `MailUniversalDistributionGroup`). You can use any value that uniquely identifies the distribution group.  <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/>  All the properties and membership of the distribution group are copied to the Office 365 Group. <br/>  The alias and proxy addresses of the distribution group are moved to the Office 365 Group, and are replaced on the distribution group by the values `DLMigrated_<GUID>`. The original proxy addresses are copied to the **ExtensionCustomAttribute5** attribute of the distribution group. <br/>  Office 365 groups don't have _ReportToManager_ and _ReportToOriginator_ parameters, so the values of these parameters aren't migrated from the distribution group to the Office 365 Group. The Office 365 Group behaves as if the default values of these parameters were set ( _ReportToManager_ is `$false` and _ReportToOriginator_ is `$true`). In other words, delivery status notifications (also known as DSNs, non-delivery reports, NDRs, or bounce messages) are sent to the message sender and not to the owner of the Office 365 Group.  <br/> |
| _AccessType_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Management.RecipientTasks.ModernGroupTypeInfo  <br/> | The _AccessType_ parameter specifies the privacy type for the Office 365 Group. Valid values are: <br/>  `Public`: The group content and conversations are available to everyone, and anyone can join the group without approval from a group owner. This is the default value.  <br/>  `Private`: The group content and conversations are only available to members of the group, and joining the group requires approval from a group owner.  <br/>  You can change the privacy type at any point in the lifecycle of the group. <br/> **Note**: Although a user needs to be a member to participate in a private group, anyone can send email to a private group, and receive replies from the private group.  <br/> |
| _Alias_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Alias_ parameter specifies the Exchange alias (also known as themail nickname) for the Office 365 Group. This value identifies the recipient as a mail-enabled object, and shouldn't be confused with multiple email addresses for the same recipient (also known as proxy addresses). A recipient can have only one  _Alias_ value. <br/> The value of  _Alias_ can contain letters, numbers and the characters !, #, $, %, &amp;, ', *, +, -, /, =, ?, ^, _, `, {, |, } and ~. Periods (.) are allowed, but each period must be surrounded by other valid characters (for example, `help.desk`). Unicode characters from U+00A1 to U+00FF are also allowed. The maximum length of the  _Alias_ value is 64 characters. <br/> When you create an Office 365 Group without using the  _EmailAddresses_ parameter, the _Alias_ value you specify is used to generate the primary email address ( _\<alias\>_@ _\<domain\>_). Supported Unicode characters are mapped to best-fit US-ASCII text characters. For example, U+00F6 (รถ) is changed to oe in the primary email address.  <br/> If you don't use the  _Alias_ parameter when you create an Office 365 Group, the value of the _DisplayName_ parameter is used. Spaces are removed, unsupported characters are converted to question marks (?), and numbers may be added to maintain the uniqueness of the _Alias_ value. <br/> |
| _AlwaysSubscribeMembersToCalendarEvents_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _AlwaysSubscribeMembersToCalendarEvents_ switch controls the default subscription settings of new members that are added to the Office 365 Group. <br/>  If you use this switch without a value, all future members that are added to the group will have their subscriptions set to `ReplyAndEvents`.  <br/>  If you use this exact syntax: `-AlwaysSubscribeMembersToCalendarEvents:$false`, all future members that are added to the group will have their subscriptions set to  `ReplyOnly`.  <br/>  Group members can change their own subscription settings, which can override your intended use of this switch. <br/>  The _AutoSubscribeNewMembers_ switch overrides this switch. <br/> |
| _AutoSubscribeNewMembers_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _AutoSubscribeNewMembers_ switch specifies whether to automatically subscribe new members that are added to the Office 365 Groupto conversations and calendar events. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> You need to use this switch with the  _SubscriptionEnabled_ switch. <br/> |
| _Classification_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _ConvertClosedDlToPrivateGroup_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _ConvertClosedDlToPrivateGroup_ switch specifies whether to migrate the closed distribution group to a private Office 365 Group. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> By default, this switch is always applied when migrating closed distribution groups, and will eventually be deprecated.  <br/> If the distribution group has the value  `Closed` for the _MemberDepartRestriction_ or _MemberJoinRestriction_ parameters, the distribution group will always be migrated to a private Office 365 Group. For open distribution groups, the migrated Office 365 Group is always public, not private. <br/> You can only use this switch with the  _DlIdentity_ parameter. <br/> |
| _DeleteDlAfterMigration_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _DeleteDlAfterMigration_ switch specifies whether to delete the distribution group after it's migrated to an Office 365 Group. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> You can only use this switch with the  _DlIdentity_ parameter. <br/> |
| _DisplayName_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _DisplayName_ parameter specifies the name of the Office 365 Group. The display name is visible in the Exchange admin center, address lists, and Outlook. The maximum length is 256 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("). <br/> For Office 365 groups, the  _DisplayName_ value is used in the unique **Name** property. However, because the _DisplayName_ value doesn't need to be unique, the _DisplayName_ value is appended with an underscore character (_) and a short GUID value when it's used for the **Name** property. <br/> |
| _EmailAddresses_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.ProxyAddressCollection  <br/> | The _EmailAddresses_ parameter specifies all the email addresses (proxy addresses) for the recipient, including the primary SMTP address. In on-premises Exchange organizations, the primary SMTP address and other proxy addresses are typically set by email address policies. However, you can use this parameter to configure other proxy addresses for the recipient. For more information, see[Email address policies in Exchange 2016](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb232171.aspx).  <br/>  Valid syntax for this parameter is `<Type>:<emailaddress1>,<Type>:<emailaddress2>...`. The optional  _\<Type\>_ value specifies the type of email address. Some examples of valid values include: <br/>  `SMTP`: The primary SMTP address. You can use this value only once in a command.  <br/>  `smtp`: Other SMTP email addresses.  <br/>  `X400`: X.400 addresses in on-premises Exchange.  <br/>  `X500`: X.500 addresses in on-premises Exchange.  <br/>  If you don't include a _\<Type\>_ value for an email address, the value `smtp` is assumed. Note that Exchange doesn't validate the syntax of custom address types (including X.400 addresses). Therefore, you need to verify that any custom addresses are formatted correctly. <br/>  To specify the primary SMTP email address, you can use any of the following methods: <br/>  Use the _\<Type\>_ value `SMTP` on the address. <br/>  The first email address when you don't use any _\<Type\>_ values, or when you use multiple _\<Type\>_ values of `smtp`.  <br/>  If it's available, use the _PrimarySmtpAddress_ parameter instead. You can't use the _EmailAddresses_ parameter and the _PrimarySmtpAddress_ parameter in the same command. <br/>  To replace all existing proxy email addresses with the values you specify, use the following syntax: `"<Type>:<emailaddress1>","<Type>:<emailaddress2>"...`.  <br/>  To add or remove specify proxy addresses without affecting other existing values, use the following syntax: `@{Add="<Type>:<emailaddress1>","<Type>:<emailaddress2>"...; Remove="<Type>:<emailaddress2>","<Type>:<emailaddress2>"...}`.  <br/> |
| _ExecutingUser_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.RecipientIdParameter  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ExoErrorAsWarning_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _ExoErrorAsWarning_ switch specifies that Exchange Online errors that you encounter while creating the Office 365 Group are treated as warnings, not errors. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> Creating Office 365 groups involves background operations in Azure Active Directory and Exchange Online. Errors that you might encounter in Exchange Online don't prevent the creation of the group (and therefore aren't really errors), because the group object in Azure Active Directory is synchronized back to Exchange Online.  <br/> |
| _HiddenGroupMembershipEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _HiddenGroupMembershipEnabled_ switch specifies whether to hide the members of the Office 365 Group from users who aren't members of the group. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> You can use this setting to help comply with regulations that require you to hide group membership from outsiders (for example, an Office 365 Group group that represents students enrolled in a class).  <br/> **Note**: You can't change this setting after you create the group. If you create the group with hidden membership, you can't edit the group later to reveal the membership to the group.  <br/> |
| _Language_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Globalization.CultureInfo  <br/> |The  _Language_ parameter specifies the language preference for the Office 365 Group. <br/> Valid input for this parameter is a supported culture code value from the Microsoft .NET Framework **CultureInfo** class. For example, `da-DK` for Danish or `ja-JP` for Japanese. For more information, see[CultureInfo Class](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=184859).  <br/> |
| _MailboxRegion_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |PARAMVALUE: String  <br/> |
| _ManagedBy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.RecipientIdParameter[]  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _Members_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.RecipientIdParameter[]  <br/> | The _Members_ parameter specifies the recipients (mail-enabled objects) that are members of the Office 365 Group. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the recipient. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/>  To enter multiple values, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>,...<valueX>`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, use the following syntax:  `"<value1>","<value2>",..."<valueX>"`.  <br/> |
| _Name_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Name_ parameter specifies the name of the Office 365 Group. The maximum length is 64 characters. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks ("). <br/> The value that you use for this is parameter is appended with an underscore character (_) and a short GUID value.  <br/> |
| _Notes_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Notes_ parameter specifies the description of the Office 365 Group. If the value contains spaces, enclose the value in quotation marks. <br/> |
| _Owner_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.RecipientIdParameter  <br/> | The _Owner_ parameter specifies one or more owners for the Office 365 Group. Owners are group members who have certain privileges, such as the ability to edit group properties. <br/>  The owner you specify for this parameter must be a mailbox or mail user (a mail-enabled security principal that can have permissions assigned). You can use any value that uniquely identifies the owner. For example: <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  _\<domain name\>_\ _\<account name\>_ <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> **LegacyExchangeDN** <br/> **SamAccountName** <br/>  User ID or user principal name (UPN) <br/>  You can specify multiple owners separated by commas <br/> |
| _PrimarySmtpAddress_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.SmtpAddress  <br/> |The  _PrimarySmtpAddress_ parameter specifies the primary return email address that's used for the recipient. If it's available on this cmdlet, you can't use the _EmailAddresses_ and _PrimarySmtpAddress_ parameters in the same command. <br/> |
| _RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled_ parameter specifies whether to accept messages only from authenticated (internal) senders. Valid values are: <br/>  `$true`: Messages are accepted only from authenticated (internal) senders. Messages from unauthenticated (external) senders are rejected.  <br/>  `$false`: Messages are accepted from authenticated (internal) and unauthenticated (external) senders.  <br/> |
| _SubscriptionEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _SubscriptionEnabled_ switch specifies whether subscriptions to conversations and calendar events are enabled for the Office 365 Group. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
| _SuppressWarmupMessage_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter has been deprecated and is no longer used.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
