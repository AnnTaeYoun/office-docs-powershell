# Get-DynamicDistributionGroup

This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other. 
  
Use the **Get-DynamicDistributionGroup** cmdlet to view existing dynamic distribution groups.
  
For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx). 
  
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup [-Identity <DynamicGroupIdParameter>] <COMMON PARAMETERS>

```

## Examples
<a name="Examples"> </a>

### Example 1

This example returns a summary list of all dynamic distribution groups in your organization.
  
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup
```

### Example 2

This example returns detailed information about the dynamic distribution group named Marketing Department.
  
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup -Identity "Marketing Department" | Format-List
```

### Example 3

This example returns all dynamic distribution groups whose names contain the string "research" and shows the group owners.
  
```
Get-DynamicDistributionGroup -Anr *research* | Format-Table Name, ManagedBy -Auto
```

### Example 4

This example returns the members for the dynamic distribution group named Full Time Employees. The first command stores the dynamic distribution group object in the variable  `$FTE`. The second command uses the **Get-Recipient** cmdlet to list the recipients that match the criteria defined for the dynamic distribution group.
  
```
$FTE = Get-DynamicDistributionGroup "Full Time Employees"; Get-Recipient -RecipientPreviewFilter $FTE.RecipientFilter
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

A dynamic distribution group queries mail-enabled objects and builds the group membership based on the results. The group membership is recalculated whenever an email message is sent to the group. 
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Anr_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> | The _Anr_ parameter specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string. The default attributes searched are: <br/> **CommonName (CN)** <br/> **DisplayName** <br/> **FirstName** <br/> **LastName** <br/> **Alias** <br/> |
| _Credential_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.PSCredential  <br/> |The  _Credential_ parameter specifies the user name and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions. <br/> This parameter requires the creation and passing of a credential object. This credential object is created by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet. For more information, see[Get-Credential](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=142122).  <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _Filter_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The  _Filter_ parameter indicates the OPath filter used to filter recipients. <br/> For more information about the filterable properties, see [Filterable properties for the -Filter parameter](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb738155.aspx).  <br/> |
| _Identity_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.DynamicGroupIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the dynamic distribution group that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the dynamic distribution group. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _IgnoreDefaultScope_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/>  The _IgnoreDefaultScope_ switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope. <br/>  Using the _IgnoreDefaultScope_ switch introduces the following restrictions: <br/>  You can't use the _DomainController_ parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically. <br/>  You can only use the DN for the _Identity_ parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted. <br/> |
| _IncludeSystemObjects_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ManagedBy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.GeneralRecipientIdParameter  <br/> | The _ManagedBy_ parameter filters the results by the owner of the group. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the owner. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _OrganizationalUnit_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.OrganizationalUnitIdParameter  <br/> | The _OrganizationalUnit_ parameter filters the results based on the object's location in Active Directory. Only objects that exist in the specified location are returned. Valid input for this parameter is an organizational unit (OU) or domain that's visible using the **Get-OrganizationalUnit** cmdlet. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OU or domain. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Canonical name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _ReadFromDomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _ReadFromDomainController_ switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch. <br/> > [!NOTE]> By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.           |
| _ResultSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The  _ResultSize_ parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use `unlimited` for the value of this parameter. The default value is `1000`.  <br/> |
| _SortBy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> | The _SortBy_ parameter specifies the property to sort the results by. You can sort by only one property at a time. The results are sorted in ascending order. <br/>  If the default view doesn't include the property you're sorting by, you can append the command with `| Format-Table -Auto <Property1>,<Property2>...` to create a new view that contains all of the properties that you want to see. Wildcards (*) in the property names are supported. <br/>  You can sort by the following properties: <br/> **Name** <br/> **DisplayName** <br/> **Alias** <br/> |
