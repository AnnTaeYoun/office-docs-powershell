# Get-OfflineAddressBook

This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.
  
Use the **Get-OfflineAddressBook** cmdlet to view offline address books (OABs).
  
By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, **Manage role groups**. 
  
For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Server_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.ServerIdParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/> **Note**: This parameter isn't relevant in Exchange 2013 or later. The **Server** property for an OAB is blank, because the OAB is generated by an arbitration mailbox. <br/>  The _Server_ parameter returns all of the OABs that are generated by the specified Exchange 2010 or earlier server. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  FQDN <br/> **ExchangeLegacyDN** <br/>  GUID <br/>  You can't use this parameter with the _Identity_ parameter. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _Identity_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.OfflineAddressBookIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the OAB that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the OAB. For example: <br/>  Name or \Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  You can't use this parameter with the _Server_ parameter. <br/> |
