# Address book cmdlets in Exchange Online

> [!NOTE]
> These cmdlets are available in the Address Lists role. By default in Exchange Online, the Address List role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use any cmdlets that require the Address List role, you need to add the role to a role group. For more information, see the "Add a role to a role group" section in the topic, [Manage role groups](https://technet.mcirosoft.com/library/ab9b7a3b-bf67-4ba1-bde5-8e6ac174b82c.aspx).
