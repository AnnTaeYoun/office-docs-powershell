You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.

## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.RoleGroupMemberIdParameter  <br/> |The  _Identity_ parameter specifies the role group for which member information should be retrieved. If the role group name contains spaces, enclose the name in quotation marks ("). <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _ReadFromDomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _ReadFromDomainController_ switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch. <br/> > [!NOTE]> By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.           |
| _ResultSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The  _ResultSize_ parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use `unlimited` for the value of this parameter. The default value is `1000`.  <br/> |
