# Remove-HybridConfiguration

This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other. 
  
Use the **Remove-HybridConfiguration** cmdlet to delete the **HybridConfiguration** Active Directory object for your on-premises Exchange organization.
  
For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx). 
  
```
Remove-HybridConfiguration [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

```

This example removes the **HybridConfiguration** object for the hybrid deployment.
  
```
Remove-HybridConfiguration
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

Removing a **HybridConfiguration** object should typically only be performed in circumstances where the hybrid deployment state is corrupt and under the direction of Microsoft Customer Service and Support. After removing the **HybridConfiguration** object, your existing hybrid deployment configuration settings aren't disabled or removed. However, when the Hybrid Configuration wizard is run again after removing the **HybridConfiguration** object, the wizard won't have a hybrid configuration reference point for your existing feature settings. As a result, it will automatically create a **HybridConfiguration** object and record the new hybrid deployment configuration feature values defined in the wizard. The feature settings associated with the hybrid deployment, such as organization relationship or Send and Receive connector parameters, which were configured with the **HybridConfiguration** object that's removed, aren't removed or modified until the Hybrid Configuration wizard is run again.
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The  _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
