## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

Users can set up people subscriptions between supported networking services and their cloud-based mailbox. Currently, only LinkedIn people connections are supported. The **Get-ConnectSubscription** cmdlet returns the list of connections that have been set up in your organization. It can also return additional information such as the current connection status of each connection and the time of the most recent successful synchronization.
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _AggregationType_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Transport.Sync.Common.Subscription.Pim.AggregationType  <br/> | The _AggregationType_ parameter filters the results by type. The acceptable values for this parameter are: <br/>  `All` <br/>  `Aggregation` <br/>  `Migration` <br/>  `Mirrored` <br/>  `PeopleConnection` <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _Identity_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.AggregationSubscriptionIdParameter  <br/> |The  _Identity_ parameter specifies a unique value that identifies a connection between a cloud-based mailbox and a contact subscription. This value is generated by the provider after a successful connection is made. <br/> |
| _IncludeReport_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _IncludeReport_ switch specifies whether to return additional details, which can be used for troubleshooting. <br/> |
| _Mailbox_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxIdParameter  <br/> | The _Mailbox_ parameter specifies the mailbox that contains the subscription. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  _\<domain name\>_\ _\<account name\>_ <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> **LegacyExchangeDN** <br/> **SamAccountName** <br/>  User ID or user principal name (UPN) <br/> |
| _ResultSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The  _ResultSize_ parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use `unlimited` for the value of this parameter. The default value is `1000`.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
