- **AllowedToSpoof**: The three possible values are `Yes` (messages that contain any spoofed sender email addresses in your organization are allowed from the source messaging server), `No` (messages that contain any spoofed sender email addresses in your organization are not allowed from the source messaging server), and `Partial` (messages that contain some spoofed sender email addresses in your organization are allowed from the source messaging server. Use the _Detailed_ switch to see the specific sender email addresses.).
