Safe Links is a feature in Advanced Threat Protection that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. For more information, see [ATP safe links in Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=846016).
  
ATP can also protect files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams by preventing users from opening and downloading files that are identified as malicious.
