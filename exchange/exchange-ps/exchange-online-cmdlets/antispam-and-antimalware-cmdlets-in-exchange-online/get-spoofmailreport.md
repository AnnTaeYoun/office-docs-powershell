# Get-SpoofMailReport

This cmdlet is available only in the cloud-based service.
  
Use the **Get-SpoofMailReport** cmdlet to view information about insider spoofing in your cloud-based organization. Insider spoofing is where the sender's email address in an inbound message appears to represent your organization, but the actual identity of the sender is different. Insider spoofing is a common tactic that's used in phishing messages to obtain user credentials or steal money.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This cmdlet is only available in Office 365 Enterprise E5, or with Advanced Threat Protection licenses.

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The spoof mail report is a feature in Advanced Threat Protection that you can use to query information about insider spoofing detections in the last 30 days. For the reporting period you specify, the **Get-SpoofMailReport** cmdlet returns the following information:
  
- **Date**: Date the message was sent.
    
- **Event Type**: Typically, this value is `SpoofMail`.
    
- **Direction**: This value is `Inbound`.
    
- **Domain**: The sender domain. This corresponds to one of your organization's accepted domains.
    
- **Action**: Typically, this value is `GoodMail` or `CaughtAsSpam`.
    
- **Spoofed Sender**: The spoofed email address or domain in your organization from which the messages appear to be coming.
    
- **True Sender**: The organizational domain of the PTR record, or pointer record, of the sending IP address, also known as the reverse DNS address. If the sending IP address does not have a PTR record, this field will be blank and the Sender IP column will be filled in. Both columns will not be filled in at the same time.
    
- **Sender IP**: The IP address or address range of the source messaging server. If the sending IP address does have a PTR record, this field will be blank and the True Sender column will be filled in. Both columns will not be filled in at the same time.
    
- **Count**: The number of spoofed messages that were sent to your organization from the source messaging server during the specified time period.
