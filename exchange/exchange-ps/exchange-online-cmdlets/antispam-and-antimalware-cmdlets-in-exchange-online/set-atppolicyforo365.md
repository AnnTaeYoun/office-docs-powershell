## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

Safe Links is a feature in Advanced Threat Protection that checks links in email messages to see if they lead to malicious web sites. For more information, see [ATP safe links in Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=857638).
  
ATP can also protect files in SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams by preventing users from opening and downloading files that are identified as malicious. For more information, see [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=857638).
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you.

## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _AllowClickThrough_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _AllowClickThrough_parameter specifies whether to allow users to click through to the original blocked URL in Office 365 ProPlus. Valid values are:  <br/>  `$true`: Users are allowed to click through to the original URL. This is the default value.  <br/>  `$false`: Users aren't allowed to click through to the original URL.  <br/> |
| _BlockUrls_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MultiValuedProperty  <br/> |The  _BlockUrls_ parameter specifies the URLs that are always blocked by Safe Links scanning. You can specify multiple values separated by semicolons. <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _EnableATPForSPOTeamsODB_parameter specifies whether ATP is enabled for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams. Valid values are:  <br/>  `$true`: ATP is enabled for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams.  <br/>  `$false`: ATP is disabled for SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams. This is the default value.  <br/> |
| _EnableSafeLinksForClients_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _EnableSafeLinksForClients_parameter specifies whether Safe Links is enabled for Office 365 ProPlus clients. Valid values are:  <br/>  `$true`: Safe Links are enabled for Office clients.  <br/>  `$false`: Safe Links are disabled for Office clients. This is the default value.  <br/> |
| _EnableSafeLinksForWebAccessCompanion_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _Identity_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.AtpPolicyForO365IdParameter  <br/> |The  _Identity_parameter specifies the ATP policy that you want to modify. There's only one policy named Default.  <br/> |
| _TrackClicks_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _TrackClicks_ parameter specifies whether to track user clicks related to blocked URLs. Valid values are: <br/>  `$true`: User clicks are tracked. This is the default value.  <br/>  `$false`: User clicks aren't tracked.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The  _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
