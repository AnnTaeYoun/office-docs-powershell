## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The **Get-UMMailboxPIN** cmdlet returns information calculated from the PIN data stored in encrypted form in the user's mailbox. This cmdlet also shows whether the mailbox or user access has been locked out.
  
After this task is completed, you can view information on a user's mailbox.
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Credential_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.PSCredential  <br/> |The _Credential_ parameter specifies the user name and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions. <br/> This parameter requires the creation and passing of a credential object. This credential object is created by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet. For more information, see[Get-Credential](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=142122).  <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _Identity_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/> _\<domain name\>_\ _\<account name\>_ <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> **LegacyExchangeDN** <br/> **SamAccountName** <br/>  User ID or user principal name (UPN) <br/> |
| _IgnoreDefaultScope_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange. <br/>  The _IgnoreDefaultScope_ switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope. <br/>  Using the _IgnoreDefaultScope_ switch introduces the following restrictions: <br/>  You can't use the _DomainController_ parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically. <br/>  You can only use the DN for the _Identity_ parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted. <br/> |
| _IgnoreErrors_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _IgnoreErrors_ switch specifies whether errors that may occur when running this cmdlet are written as warnings. <br/> |
| _ReadFromDomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The _ReadFromDomainController_ switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch. <br/> > [!NOTE]> By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.           |
| _ResultSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _ResultSize_ parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use `unlimited` for the value of this parameter. The default value is `1000`.  <br/> |
