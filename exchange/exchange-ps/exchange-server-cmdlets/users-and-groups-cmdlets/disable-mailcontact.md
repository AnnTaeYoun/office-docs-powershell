## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The **Disable-MailContact** cmdlet mail-disables existing mail contacts by removing the email attributes that are required by Exchange. Mail-disabled contacts are invisible to the **\*-MailContact** cmdlets (with the exception of **Enable-MailContact** ). All contacts (mail-enabled or not) are visible to the **Get-Contact** and **Set-Contact** cmdlets.
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailContactIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the mail contact that you want to mail-disable. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mail contact. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _IgnoreDefaultScope_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _IgnoreDefaultScope_ switch tells the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently available in the default scope. <br/>  Using the _IgnoreDefaultScope_ switch introduces the following restrictions: <br/>  You can't use the _DomainController_ parameter. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically. <br/>  You can only use the DN for the _Identity_ parameter. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted. <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
