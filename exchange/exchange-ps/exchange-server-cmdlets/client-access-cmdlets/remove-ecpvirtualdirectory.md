# Remove-EcpVirtualDirectory

This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange. 
  
Use the **Remove-EcpVirtualDirectory** cmdlet to remove Exchange Control Panel (ECP) virtual directories from Internet Information Services (IIS) on Microsoft Exchange servers. The ECP virtual directory manages the Exchange admin center.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The ECP web management interface was introduced in MicrosoftExchange Server 2010. In Exchange Server 2013 and Exchange Server 2016, the EAC virtual directories and the corresponding management cmdlets still use ECP in the name. You can use these cmdlets to manage ECP virtual directories on Exchange 2010, Exchange 2013, and Exchange 2016 servers. 
  
For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx). 
  
```
Remove-EcpVirtualDirectory -Identity <VirtualDirectoryIdParameter> [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

```

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.VirtualDirectoryIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the virtual directory that you want to remove. <br/>  You can use any value that uniquely identifies the virtual directory. For example: <br/>  Name or `<Server>\Name` <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/>  The **Name** value uses the syntax " `<VirtualDirectoryName> (<WebsiteName>)`" from the properties of the virtual directory. You can specify the wildcard character (*) instead of the default website by using the syntax  `<VirtualDirectoryName>*`.  <br/>  Remote removal of an ECP virtual directory isn't supported. You need run this command from the local computer. <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
