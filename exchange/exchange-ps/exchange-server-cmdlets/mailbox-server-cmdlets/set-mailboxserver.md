## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxServerIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the Mailbox server that you want to modify. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the server. For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  GUID <br/> |
| _AutoDagServerConfigured_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _AutoDatabaseMountDial_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Directory.SystemConfiguration.AutoDatabaseMountDial  <br/> | The _AutoDatabaseMountDial_ parameter specifies the automatic database mount behavior for a continuous replication environment after a database failover on the Mailbox server. You can use the following values: <br/>  `BestAvailability`: The database automatically mounts immediately after a failover if the copy queue length is less than or equal to 12. The copy queue length is the number of logs recognized by the passive copy that needs to be replicated. If the copy queue length is more than 12, the database doesn't automatically mount. When the copy queue length is less than or equal to 12, Exchange attempts to replicate the remaining logs to the passive copy and mounts the database.  <br/>  `GoodAvailability`: The database automatically mounts immediately after a failover if the copy queue length is less than or equal to six. The copy queue length is the number of logs recognized by the passive copy that needs to be replicated. If the copy queue length is more than six, the database doesn't automatically mount. When the copy queue length is less than or equal to six, Exchange attempts to replicate the remaining logs to the passive copy and mounts the database.  <br/>  `Lossless`: The database doesn't automatically mount until all logs that were generated on the active copy have been copied to the passive copy. This setting also causes Active Manager's best copy selection algorithm to sort potential candidates for activation based on the database copy's activation preference value and not its copy queue length.  <br/>  The default value is `GoodAvailability`. If you specify either  `BestAvailability` or `GoodAvailability`, and all of the logs from the active copy haven't been replicated to the passive copy, you may lose some mailbox data. However, the Safety Net feature, (which is enabled by default) helps protect against data loss by resubmitting messages that are in Safety Net.  <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairIntervalEndWindow_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |The _CalendarRepairIntervalEndWindow_ parameter specifies the number of days into the future to repair calendar items in mailboxes on the Mailbox server. The default value is 30. This means the Calendar Repair Assistant repairs meetings in calendars up to 30 days from now. Meetings that are scheduled to occur more than 30 days in the future aren't repaired. <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairLogDirectorySizeLimit_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> | The _CalendarRepairLogDirectorySizeLimit_ parameter specifies the maximum size of calendar repair log directory on the Mailbox server. When the directory reaches its maximum size, the server deletes the oldest log files first. <br/>  Calendar repair log files begin with the name prefix `CRA`. The maximum size of the calendar repair log directory is calculated as the total size of all log files that have the  `CRA` name prefix. Other files aren't counted in the total directory size calculation. Renaming old log files or copying other files into the calendar repair log directory could cause the directory to exceed its specified maximum size. <br/>  The default value is 500 megabytes (MB). <br/>  When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units: <br/>  `B` (bytes) <br/>  `KB` (kilobytes) <br/>  `MB` (megabytes) <br/>  `GB` (gigabytes) <br/>  `TB` (terabytes) <br/>  Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte. <br/>  If you enter the value `unlimited`, no size limit is imposed on the calendar repair log directory.  <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairLogEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | The _CalendarRepairLogEnabled_ parameter specifies whether the Calendar Repair Attendant logs items that it repairs on the Mailbox server. The repair log doesn't contain failed repair attempts. <br/>  Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/>  The value of this parameter affects the following parameters: <br/> _CalendarRepairLogDirectorySizeLimit_ <br/> _CalendarRepairLogFileAgeLimit_ <br/> _CalendarRepairLogPath_ <br/> _CalendarRepairLogSubjectLoggingEnabled_ <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairLogFileAgeLimit_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.EnhancedTimeSpan  <br/> |The _CalendarRepairLogFileAgeLimit_ parameter specifies the calendar repair log maximum file age on the Mailbox server. Log files older than the specified value are deleted. The default value is 10 days. <br/> To specify a value, enter it as a time span:  `dd.hh:mm:ss` where `dd` = days, `hh` = hours, `mm` = minutes, and `ss` = seconds. <br/> For example, to specify 30 days, enter  `30.00:00:00`. The value  `00:00:00` prevents the automatic removal of calendar repair log files because of their age. <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairLogPath_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.LocalLongFullPath  <br/> |The _CalendarRepairLogPath_ parameter specifies the location of the calendar repair log files on the Mailbox server. The default value is `%ExchangeInstallPath%Logging\Calendar Repair Assistant`.  <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairLogSubjectLoggingEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _CalendarRepairLogSubjectLoggingEnabled_ parameter specifies whether to include the subject of repaired calendar items in the calendar repair log on the Mailbox server. Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairMissingItemFixDisabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _CalendarRepairMissingItemFixDisabled_ parameter specifies whether the Calendar Repair Assistant won't fix missing calendar items in mailboxes on the Mailbox server.Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> |
| _CalendarRepairMode_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.CalendarRepairType  <br/> |The _CalendarRepairMode_ parameter specifies the Calendar Repair Assistant mode on the Mailbox server. Valid values for this parameter are `ValidateOnly` or `RepairAndValidate`. The default value is  `RepairAndValidate`.  <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _DatabaseCopyActivationDisabledAndMoveNow_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _DatabaseCopyActivationDisabledAndMoveNow_ parameter specifies whether to prevent databases from being mounted on this Mailbox server if there are other healthy copies of the databases on other Mailbox servers. It will also immediately move any mounted databases on the server to other servers if copies exist and are healthy. <br/> Valid input for this parameter is  `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> Setting this parameter to  `$true`won't cause databases to move to a server that has the _DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy_ parameter set to `Blocked`.  <br/> |
| _DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Directory.SystemConfiguration.DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicyType  <br/> | The _DatabaseCopyAutoActivationPolicy_ parameter specifies the type of automatic activation available for mailbox database copies on the specified Mailbox server. Valid values for this parameter are: <br/>  `Blocked`: Databases can't be automatically activated on the specified Mailbox server. In Exchange 2013 prior to Cumulative Update 7 (CU7), this setting stops server locator requests to the specified server, which prevents all client access to manually activated databases on the server if all DAG members are configured with a value of  `Blocked`. In Exchange 2013 CU7 or later versions of Exchange, server locator requests are sent to a blocked server if no other Mailbox servers are available, thus client access is not impacted.  <br/>  `IntrasiteOnly`: The database copy is allowed to be activated only on Mailbox servers in the same Active Directory site. This prevents cross-site failover and activation.  <br/>  `Unrestricted`: There are no special restrictions on activating mailbox database copies on the specified Mailbox server. This is the default value.  <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _FaultZone_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _FolderLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> | This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1). <br/>  The _FolderLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ parameter specifies whether managed folder logging is enabled on the Mailbox server. Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/>  If you specify `$true`, managed folder logging is enabled. Message activity in folders that have managed folder mailbox policies applied to them is logged.  <br/>  The value of this parameter affects the following parameters: <br/> _JournalingLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> _LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders_ <br/> _LogFileAgeLimitForManagedFolders_ <br/> _LogFileSizeLimitForManagedFolders_ <br/> _LogPathForManagedFolders_ <br/> _RetentionLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> _SubjectLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> |
| _ForceGroupMetricsGeneration_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _ForceGroupMetricsGeneration_ parameter specifies that group metrics information must be generated on the Mailbox server regardless of whether that server generates an offline address book (OAB). Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> By default, group metrics are generated only on servers that generate OABs. Group metrics information is used by MailTips to inform senders about how many recipients their messages will be sent to. You need to set this parameter to  `$true` if your organization doesn't generate OABs and you want the group metrics data to be available. <br/> |
| _IsExcludedFromProvisioning_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _IsExcludedFromProvisioning_ parameter specifies that the Mailbox server isn't considered by the OAB provisioning load balancer. Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> If you specify `$true`, the server won't be used for provisioning a new OAB or for moving existing OABs.  <br/> |
| _JournalingLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _JournalingLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ parameter specifies whether journaling activity is recorded in the managed folder log on the Mailbox server.Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> If you specify  `$true`, information about messages that were journaled in managed folders is logged. The managed folder log directory is specified by the _LogPathForManagedFolders_ parameter. <br/> |
| _Locale_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MultiValuedProperty  <br/> | The _Locale_ parameter specifies the locale of the Mailbox server. A locale is a collection of language-related user preferences such as writing system, calendar, and date format. The following are examples: <br/>  `en-US` (English - United States) <br/>  `de-AT` (German - Austria) <br/>  `es-CL` (Spanish - Chile) <br/>  For more information, see[CultureInfo Class](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=68806).  <br/>  To enter multiple values and overwrite any existing entries, use the following syntax: `<value1>,<value2>...`. If the values contain spaces or otherwise require quotation marks, you need to use the following syntax:  `"<value1>","<value2>"...`.  <br/>  To add or remove one or more values without affecting any existing entries, use the following syntax: `@{Add="<value1>","<value2>"...; Remove="<value1>","<value2>"...}`.  <br/> |
| _LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> | This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1). <br/>  The _LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders_ parameter specifies the maximum size of all managed folder logs from a single mailbox database in the managed folder log directory on the Mailbox server. When a set of log files reaches its maximum size, the server deletes the oldest log files first. <br/>  Every mailbox database on the server uses a different log file name prefix (for example, `Managed_Folder_Assistant[` _Mailbox database name_ `]`). Therefore, the maximum size of the managed folder log directory is the number of mailbox databases multiplied by the value of the _LogDirectorySizeLimitForManagedFolders_ parameter. Other files aren't counted in the total size calculation. Renaming old log files or copying other files into the managed folder log directory could cause the directory to exceed its specified maximum size. <br/>  When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units: <br/>  `B` (bytes) <br/>  `KB` (kilobytes) <br/>  `MB` (megabytes) <br/>  `GB` (gigabytes) <br/>  `TB` (terabytes) <br/>  Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte. <br/>  The default value is `unlimited`, which means no size limit is imposed on the managed folder log directory.  <br/> |
| _LogFileAgeLimitForManagedFolders_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.EnhancedTimeSpan  <br/> |This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).  <br/> The _LogFileAgeLimitForManagedFolders_ parameter specifies how long to retain managed folder logs on the Mailbox server. Log files older than the specified value are deleted. <br/> To specify a value, enter it as a time span:  `dd.hh:mm:ss` where `dd` = days, `hh` = hours, `mm` = minutes, and `ss` = seconds. <br/> For example, to specify a 30 days, enter  `30.00:00:00`. The default value is  `00:00:00`, which prevents the automatic removal of managed folder log files because of their age.  <br/> |
| _LogFileSizeLimitForManagedFolders_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> | This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1). <br/>  The _LogFileSizeLimitForManagedFolders_ parameter specifies the maximum size for each managed folder log file on the Mailbox server. When a log file reaches its maximum size, a new log file is created. The default value is 10 megabytes (MB). <br/>  When you enter a value, qualify the value with one of the following units: <br/>  `B` (bytes) <br/>  `KB` (kilobytes) <br/>  `MB` (megabytes) <br/>  `GB` (gigabytes) <br/>  `TB` (terabytes) <br/>  Unqualified values are typically treated as bytes, but small values may be rounded up to the nearest kilobyte. <br/>  If you enter the value `unlimited`, no size limit is imposed on a managed folder log file.  <br/> |
| _LogPathForManagedFolders_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.LocalLongFullPath  <br/> |This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).  <br/> The _LogPathForManagedFolders_ parameter specifies the location of the managed folder log files on the Mailbox server. The default value is `%ExchangeInstallPath%Logging\ Managed Folder Assistant`.  <br/> |
| _ManagedFolderAssistantSchedule_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Common.ScheduleInterval[]  <br/> | The _ManagedFolderAssistantSchedule_ parameter specifies the intervals each week during which the Managed Folder Assistant applies messaging records management (MRM) settings to managed folders in mailboxes on the Mailbox server. The interval format is _StartDay.Time-EndDay.Time_. You can use the following values for the start and end days:  <br/>  Full name of the day <br/>  Abbreviated name of the day <br/>  Integer from 0 through 6, where 0 = Sunday <br/>  The start time and end time must be at least 15 minutes apart. Minutes are rounded down to 0, 15, 30, or 45. If you specify more than one interval, there must be at least 15 minutes between each interval. <br/>  The following are examples: <br/>  "Sun.11:30 PM-Mon.1:30 AM" <br/>  6.22:00-6.22:15 (The assistant will run from Saturday at 10:00 PM until Saturday at 10:15 PM.) <br/>  "Monday.4:30 AM-Monday.5:30 AM","Wednesday.4:30 AM-Wednesday.5:30 AM" (The assistant will run on Monday and Wednesday mornings from 4:30 until 5:30.) <br/>  "Sun.1:15 AM-Monday.23:00" <br/>  If the Managed Folder Assistant doesn't finish processing the mailboxes on the server during the time that you've scheduled, it automatically resumes processing where it left off the next time it runs. <br/> |
| _MAPIEncryptionRequired_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _MAPIEncryptionRequired_ parameter specifies whether Exchange blocks MAPI client connections to the Mailbox server that don't use encrypted remote procedure calls (RPCs). Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> |
| _MaximumActiveDatabases_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |The _MaximumActiveDatabases_ parameter specifies the maximum number of databases that can be mounted on the Mailbox server. <br/> When the maximum number is reached, the database copies on the server won't be activated if a failover or switchover occurs. If the copies are already active on a server, the Information Store on the server won't allow databases to be mounted.  <br/> The default value is blank ( `$null`), which means no maximum value is configured.  <br/> |
| _MaximumPreferredActiveDatabases_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |The _MaximumPreferredActiveDatabases_ parameter specifies a preferred maximum number of databases that theMailbox server should have. This value is different from the actual maximum, which is configured using the _MaximumActiveDatabases_ parameter. The value of _MaximumPreferredActiveDatabases_ is only honored during best copy and server selection, database and server switchovers, and when rebalancing the DAG. <br/> The default value is blank ( `$null`), which means no maximum value is configured.  <br/> |
| _MigrationLogFilePath_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.LocalLongFullPath  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _MigrationLogLoggingLevel_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MigrationEventType  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _MigrationLogMaxAge_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.EnhancedTimeSpan  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _MigrationLogMaxDirectorySize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.ByteQuantifiedSize  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _MigrationLogMaxFileSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.ByteQuantifiedSize  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _RetentionLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).  <br/> The _RetentionLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ parameter specifies whether retention policy activity is recorded in the managed folder log on the Mailbox server. Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> If you specify  `$true`, information about messages in managed folders that have been processed because they have reached their retention limits is logged. The managed folder log directory is specified by the _LogPathForManagedFolders_ parameter. <br/> |
| _SharingPolicySchedule_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Common.ScheduleInterval[]  <br/> | The _SharingPolicySchedule_ parameter specifies the intervals each week during which the sharing policy runs on the Mailbox server. The Sharing Policy Assistant checks permissions on shared calendar items and contact folders in users' mailboxes against the assigned sharing policy. The assistant lowers or removes permissions according to the policy. The format is _StartDay.Time-EndDay.Time_. You can use the following values for the start and end days:  <br/>  Full name of the day <br/>  Abbreviated name of the day <br/>  Integer from 0 through 6, where 0 = Sunday <br/>  The start time and end time must be at least 15 minutes apart. Minutes are rounded down to 0, 15, 30, or 45. If you specify more than one interval, there must be at least 15 minutes between each interval. <br/>  The following are examples: <br/>  "Sun.11:30 PM-Mon.1:30 AM" <br/>  6.22:00-6.22:15 (The assistant will run from Saturday at 10:00 PM until Saturday 10:15 PM.) <br/> |
| _SubjectLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |This parameter is used for coexistence with Exchange 2010. Specifically, this parameter works with messaging records management (MRM) 1.0 (managed folders). This parameter doesn't work with MRM 2.0 (retention policies) that were introduced in Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1).  <br/> The _SubjectLogForManagedFoldersEnabled_ parameter specifies whether to include the subject of messages in the managed folder logs on the Mailbox server. Valid input for this parameter is `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`.  <br/> By default, the subject of messages is blank in the managed folder log.  <br/> |
| _SubmissionServerOverrideList_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MultiValuedProperty  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _WacDiscoveryEndpoint_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The _WacDiscoveryEndpoint_ parameter specifies the discovery endpoint for Office Online Server (formerly known as Office Web Apps Server and Web Access Companion Server) for all mailboxes on the server. For example, `https://oos.internal.contoso.com/hosting/discovery`.  <br/> Office Online Server enables users to view supported file attachments in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App).  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
