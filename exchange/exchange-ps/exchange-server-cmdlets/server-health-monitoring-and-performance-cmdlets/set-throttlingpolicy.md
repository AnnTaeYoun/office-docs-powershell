```

## Examples
<a name="Examples"> </a>

### Example 1

This example modifies a throttling policy so that users associated with this policy can have a maximum of four concurrent requests running in Exchange Web Services.
  
```
$a = Get-ThrottlingPolicy RemoteSiteUserPolicy; $a | Set-ThrottlingPolicy -EwsMaxConcurrency 4
```

### Example 2

This example modifies a throttling policy so that it restricts the number of connections for a user to three. The users associated with this policy are only able to create three Exchange Management Shell sessions. This policy also restricts to three the number of Exchange admin center operations or Exchange Web Services operations that can be executed at the same time. In addition, the _PowerShellMaxCmdletQueueDepth_ parameter specifies that 12 operations maximum are allowed to be executed by the user.
  
```
Set-ThrottlingPolicy RemoteSiteUserPolicy -PowerShellMaxConcurrency 3 -PowerShellMaxCmdletQueueDepth 12
```

### Example 3

This example modifies a throttling policy so that it restricts a user to be able to execute only 10 destructive cmdlets in 60 seconds. If the users associated with this policy exceed this number, the cmdlet pipeline execution is stopped with a throttling error message. The user needs to wait for, and then resubmit the execution of cmdlets on the open connection.
  
```
Set-ThrottlingPolicy <ThrottlingPolicyName> -PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdlets 10 -PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdletsTimePeriod 60
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

Throttling policy settings are stored in Active Directory.
  
By default, there is one default user throttling policy named GlobalThrottlingPolicy with a throttling scope of Global. Microsoft Setup creates this policy as part of the Client Access server role. You shouldn't replace, re-create, or remove the existing default throttling policy. However, you can edit any additional throttling policies with the scope of Organization or Regular if you want to change your user throttling settings. You can create polices with the scope of Organization or Regular using the **New-ThrottlingPolicy** cmdlet.
  
For more information about how to control the resources consumed by individual users, see [Exchange Workload Management](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/276740c4-bdb7-49f1-9470-ae6f2bfd65aa.aspx).
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.ThrottlingPolicyIdParameter  <br/> |The _Identity_ parameter uniquely identifies the throttling policy that you want to modify values for. The name you use is the name of the throttling policy object in Active Directory. <br/> |
| _AnonymousCutoffBalance_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _AnonymousCutoffBalance_ parameter specifies the resource consumption limits for an anonymous user before the user is completely blocked from performing operations on a specific component. <br/> |
| _AnonymousMaxBurst_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _AnonymousMaxBurst_ parameter specifies the amount of time that an anonymous user can consume an elevated amount of resources before being throttled. This is measured in milliseconds. This value is set separately for each component. <br/> |
| _AnonymousMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _AnonymousMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies how many anonymous connections can be made to a user's calendar data at the same time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If anonymous users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. The _AnonymousMaxConcurrency_ parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 1. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to `$null`.  <br/> |
| _AnonymousRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _AnonymousRechargeRate_ parameter specifies the rate at which an anonymous user's budget is charged (budget grows by) during the budget time. <br/> |
| _BookingSelfServiceCutoffBalance_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _BookingSelfServiceMaxBurst_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _BookingSelfServiceMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _BookingSelfServiceRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ComplianceMaxExpansionDGRecipients_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _ComplianceMaxExpansionDGRecipients_ parameter specifies the maximum number of recipients to expand in distribution groups when a discovery search is looking for a specified recipient. <br/> |
| _ComplianceMaxExpansionNestedDGs_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _ComplianceMaxExpansionNestedDGs_ parameter specifies the maximum number of nested distribution groups to expand when a discovery search is looking for a specified recipient. <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _ConsensusCutoffBalance_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ConsensusMaxBurst_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ConsensusMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |
| _ConsensusRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use.  <br/> |

| _CpaMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _CpaMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies how many concurrent connections a cross-premises user can have against an Exchange server at one time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. The _CpaMaxConcurrency_ parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to `$null`.  <br/> |
| _CpaRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _CpaRechargeRate_ parameter specifies the rate at which a cross-premises user budget is charged (budget grows by) during the budget time. <br/> |

When the number of mailboxes configured with the _DiscoveryMaxStatsSearchMailboxes_ parameter is exceeded, these keyword statistics won't be available. In this case, a user must copy the search results to a discovery mailbox to view the keyword statistics for the discovery search. For more information, see[In-Place eDiscovery](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/6377cb7a-3416-4e15-8571-c45d2160fc6f.aspx).  <br/> |
| _DiscoveryPreviewSearchResultsPageSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _DiscoveryPreviewSearchResultsPageSize_ parameter specifies the number of messages displayed on a single page in eDiscovery Search Preview. <br/> |
| _DiscoverySearchTimeoutPeriod_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _DiscoverySearchTimeoutPeriod_ parameter specifies the number of minutes that a discovery search will run before it times out. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> The _DomainController_ parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data. <br/> |

The _EasMaxConcurrency_ parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 10. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to `$null`.  <br/> |
| _EasMaxDeviceDeletesPerMonth_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _EasMaxDeviceDeletesPerMonth_ parameter specifies a limit to the number of Exchange ActiveSync partnerships that a user can delete per month. By default, each user can delete a maximum of 20 partnerships per calendar month. When the limit is reached, the partnership deletion attempt fails and an error message is displayed to the user. <br/> |
| _EasMaxDevices_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _EasMaxDevices_ parameter specifies a limit to the number of Exchange ActiveSync partnerships that a user can have at one time. By default, each user can create 100 Exchange ActiveSync partnerships with their Exchange account. After users exceed the limit, they must delete one of their existing partnerships before they can create any more new partnerships. An email error message describing the limitation is sent to the user when the limit is exceeded. Additionally, an event is logged in the Application log when a user exceeds the limit. <br/> |
| _EasMaxInactivityForDeviceCleanup_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _EasMaxInactivityForDeviceCleanup_ parameter specifies the length of time that a user's device partnerships will remain active.

| _IsServiceAccount_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _IsServiceAccount_ switch specifies whether you want the user accounts associated with this policy to be moderated by the per-user thresholds specified by this policy, and also by additional throttling based on the health of system resources, such as overall CPU usage. <br/> This value is set to  `$false` by default. <br/> You may want to set this value to  `$true` if you intend to associate this policy with user accounts that require higher throttling limits. An account that might require higher throttling limits is a service account that performs a lot of non-interactive work (for example, service accounts that perform IMAP mailbox migrations or nightly Windows PowerShell tasks) <br/> By setting the _IsServiceAccount_ switch to `$true`, work done by these accounts is moderated by the higher user throttling settings that you configure using the user throttling policy, but is slowed if resources start getting unhealthy.  <br/> |
| _MessageRateLimit_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _MessageRateLimit_ parameter specifies the number of messages per minute that can be submitted to transport by POP3 or IMAP4 clients that use SMTP.

| _OwaVoiceMaxBurst_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _OwaVoiceMaxBurst_ parameter specifies the amount of time that an Outlook on the web voice user can consume an elevated amount of resources before being throttled. This is measured in milliseconds. This value is set separately for each component. <br/> |
| _OwaVoiceMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _OwaVoiceMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies how many concurrent connections an Outlook on the web voice user can have against an Exchange server at one time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. The _OwaVoiceMaxConcurrency_ parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 5. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to `$null`.  <br/> |
| _OwaVoiceRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _OwaVoiceRechargeRate_ parameter specifies the rate at which an Outlook on the web voice user's budget is charged (budget grows by) during the budget time. <br/> |

This is measured in milliseconds. This value is set separately for each component. <br/> |
| _PopMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PopMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies how many concurrent connections a POP user can have against an Exchange server at one time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until a response is sent in its entirety to the requestor. If users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. The _PopMaxConcurrency_ parameter has a valid range from 0 through 2147483647 inclusive. The default value is 20. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to `$null`.  <br/> |
| _PopRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PopRechargeRate_ parameter specifies the rate at which the user budget is charged (budget grows by) during the budget time. <br/> |

This value directly affects the behavior of the _PowerShellMaxCmdlets_ and _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameters. For example, the _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameter consumes at least two operations defined by the _PowerShellMaxCmdletQueueDepth_ parameter but additional operations are also consumed by per cmdlet execution. The number of operations depends on the cmdlets that are executed. We recommend that the value for the _PowerShellMaxCmdletQueueDepth_ parameter be at least three times larger than the value of the _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameter. This parameter won't affect Exchange admin center operations or Exchange Web Services operations. <br/> |
| _PowerShellMaxCmdlets_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PowerShellMaxCmdlets_ parameter specifies the number of cmdlets that can be executed within a specific time period before their execution is stopped.

| _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> | The _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies different information depending on context: <br/>  In the context of Remote PowerShell, the _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies the maximum number of Remote PowerShell sessions that a Remote PowerShell user can have open at the same time. <br/>  In the context of Exchange Web Services, the _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies the number of concurrent cmdlet executions that a user can have at the same time. <br/>  This parameter value doesn't necessarily correlate to the number of browsers opened by the user. <br/> |
| _PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdlets_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> | The _PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdlets_ parameter specifies the number of destructive cmdlets that can be executed within a specific time period before their execution is stopped. Destructive cmdlets are cmdlets that can make significant changes to user data and configuration settings in your Exchange organization. Throttling these cmdlets may help prevent accidental data loss. The following cmdlets are designated as destructive: <br/> **Disable-Mailbox** <br/> **Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase** <br/> **Remove-AcceptedDomain** <br/> **Remove-Mailbox** <br/> **Remove-MailUser** <br/> **Remove-Organization** <br/> **Remove-SecondaryDomain** <br/> **Remove-SyncMailbox** <br/> **Remove-SyncMailUser** <br/> **Set-Mailbox** <br/> **Set-MailUser** <br/> **Set-SyncMailbox** <br/> **Set-SyncMailUser** <br/> **Start-OrganizationUpgrade** <br/> **Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy** <br/>  The time period used for this limit is specified by the _PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdletsTimePeriod_ parameter.

You set a value for this parameter when set the _PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdlets_ parameter. Both values should be set at the same time. For more information, see the description for the _PowerShellMaxDestructiveCmdlets_ parameter. <br/> |
| _PowerShellMaxOperations_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PowerShellMaxOperations_ parameter specifies the protocol-level operations used to send and receive data. If the execution of a cmdlet results in a significant number of operations (for example, if there is a lot of input/output occurring), throttling may occur. The default setting is Unlimited. <br/> |
| _PowerShellMaxRunspaces_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PowerShellMaxRunspaces_ parameter specifies the number of concurrent Windows PowerShell sessions that a user is allowed to have. The default setting is Unlimited. <br/> |
| _PowerShellMaxRunspacesTimePeriod_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PowerShellMaxRunspacesTimePeriod_ parameter specifies the time period, in seconds, that the throttling policy uses to determine how many Windows PowerShell sessions can be run. You set this value when you set the _PowerShellMaxRunspaces_ parameter. <br/> |
| _PowerShellMaxTenantConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PowerShellMaxTenantConcurrency_ parameter limits the number of concurrent Windows PowerShell connections per tenant organization. By default, the limit for concurrent Windows PowerShell connections per tenant organization is set to 9. If users in a tenant organization try to make more concurrent requests than the limit set by the _PowerShellMaxTenantConcurrency_ parameter, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. This limit is enforced even if a single user hasn't exceeded the per-user limit set by the _PowerShellMaxConcurrency_ parameter. The _PowerShellMaxTenantConcurrency_ parameter has a valid range from 0 through 100 inclusive. To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), this value should be set to `$null`.  <br/> > [!NOTE]> This property can only be set for the default throttling policy.           |
| _PowerShellMaxTenantRunspaces_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _PowerShellMaxTenantRunspaces_ parameter specifies the number of concurrent Windows PowerShell sessions that a tenant is allowed to have. <br/> |

This is measured in milliseconds. This value is set separately for each component. <br/> |
| _RcaMaxConcurrency_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _RcaMaxConcurrency_ parameter specifies how many concurrent connections an RPC Client Access user can have against an Exchange server at one time. A connection is held from the moment a request is received until the connection is closed or the connection is otherwise disconnected (for example, if the user goes offline). If users attempt to make more concurrent requests than their policy allows, the new connection attempt fails. However, the existing connections remain valid. <br/> A valid value is an integer from 0 through 4294967295, or the value  `unlimited`. The default value is 40.  <br/> To indicate that the number of concurrent connections should be unthrottled (no limit), set the value to  `unlimited`.  <br/> |
| _RcaRechargeRate_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _RcaRechargeRate_ parameter specifies the rate at which the budget for the user is charged (how mucht the budget grows by) during the budget time. <br/> |
