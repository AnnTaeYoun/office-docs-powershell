# Test-ServiceHealth

This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange. 
  
Use the **Test-ServiceHealth** cmdlet to test whether all the Microsoft Windows services that Exchange requires on a server have started. The **Test-ServiceHealth** cmdlet returns an error for any service required by a configured role when the service is set to start automatically and isn't currently running.
  
For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123552.aspx). 
  
```
Test-ServiceHealth [-ActiveDirectoryTimeout <Int32>] [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-MonitoringContext <$true | $false>] [-Server <ServerIdParameter>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]

```

## Examples

### Example 1

This example uses the **Test-ServiceHealth** command without parameters to test the services on the local server.
  
```

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _ActiveDirectoryTimeout_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Int32  <br/> |The _ActiveDirectoryTimeout_ parameter specifies the amount of time, in seconds, allowed for each Active Directory operation to complete before the operation times out. The default value is 15 seconds. <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> The _DomainController_ parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data. <br/> |
| _MonitoringContext_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Boolean  <br/> |The _MonitoringContext_ parameter specifies whether to include the associated monitoring events and performance counters in the results. Valid values for this parameter are `$true` or `$false`. The default value is  `$false`. If you specify the value  `$true`, the monitoring events and performance counters are included in the command results. Typically, you include the monitoring events and performance counters in the results when the output is passed to MicrosoftSystem Center Operations Manager (SCOM).  <br/> |
| _Server_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.ServerIdParameter  <br/> |The _Server_ parameter specifies the server on which to check that the required services are running. If you don't specify this parameter, the command checks the services on the local server. <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
