# Set-AttachmentFilterListConfig

This cmdlet is available or effective only on Edge Transport servers in on-premises Exchange.
  
Use the **Set-AttachmentFilterListConfig** cmdlet to modify the configuration of the Attachment Filtering agent on Edge Transport servers.
  
```
Set-Attachmentfilterlistconfig [-Action <Reject | Strip | SilentDelete>] [-AdminMessage <String>] [-Confirm [<SwitchParameter>]] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [-ExceptionConnectors <MultiValuedProperty>] [-RejectResponse <String>] [-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]]
```

## Examples
<a name="Examples"> </a>

### Example 1

This example modifies the action that the Attachment Filtering agent takes on an attachment that matches an entry on the attachment filter list so that both the email message and attachment aren't delivered to the recipient, and an NDR is sent to the sender.
  
```
Set-AttachmentFilterListConfig -Action Reject
```

## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

On Edge Transport servers, the Attachment Filtering agent blocks attachments in messages based on the content type or the file name of the attachment. The configuration of the Attachment Filtering agent determines how messages that contain the specified attachments are processed.
  
On Edge Transport servers, you need to be a member of the local Administrators group to run this cmdlet.
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Action_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Directory.SystemConfiguration.FilterActions  <br/> | The _Action_ parameter specifies how the Attachment Filtering agent handles an attachment that matches an entry on the attachment filter list. The default value is `Reject`. You can use one of the following values:  <br/>  `Reject`: This value prevents both the email message and attachment from being delivered to the recipient and issues a non-delivery report (NDR) to the sender.  <br/>  `Strip`: This value removes the offending attachment from the email message and allows the message and other attachments that don't match an entry on the attachment filter list through. A notification that the attachment was removed is added to the email message.  <br/>  `SilentDelete`: This value prevents both the email message and the attachment from being delivered to the recipient. No notification that the email message and attachment were blocked is sent to the sender.  <br/> |
| _AdminMessage_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The _AdminMessage_ parameter specifies the content of a text file that replaces attachments removed by the Attachment Filtering agent. The _AdminMessage_ parameter only appears when the Attachment Filtering agent is configured to remove an attachment that's been identified as bad. <br/> |
| _Confirm_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> | The _Confirm_ switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding. <br/>  Destructive cmdlets (for example, **Remove-\*** cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.  <br/>  Most other cmdlets (for example, **New-\*** and **Set-\*** cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the _Confirm_ switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding. <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> The _DomainController_ parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data. <br/> |
| _ExceptionConnectors_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.MultiValuedProperty  <br/> |The _ExceptionConnectors_ parameter specifies a list of connectors that should be excluded from attachment filtering. Attachment filters aren't applied to email messages received through these connectors. You must use the connector GUID to specify the _ExceptionConnectors_ parameter value. <br/> |
| _RejectResponse_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.String  <br/> |The _RejectResponse_ parameter specifies the message body that you want delivered in the NDR to senders whose messages contain an attachment that's blocked. The _RejectResponse_ parameter is required only if you set the _Action_ parameter to `Reject`. Don't exceed 240 characters in the parameter argument. When you pass an argument, you must enclose the _RejectResponse_ parameter value in quotation marks (") if the phrase contains spaces, for example: " `Message rejected`". The default setting is  `Message rejected due to unacceptable attachments`.  <br/> |
| _WhatIf_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _WhatIf_ switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch. <br/> |
