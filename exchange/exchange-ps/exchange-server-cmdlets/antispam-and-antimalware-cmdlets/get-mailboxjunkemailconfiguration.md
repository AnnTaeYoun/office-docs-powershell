## Detailed Description
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

The junk email settings on the mailbox are:
  
- **Enable or disable the junk email rule**: The junk email rule (a hidden Inbox rule named Junk E-mail Rule) controls the delivery of messages to the Junk Email folder or the Inbox based on the SCL Junk Email Folder threshold (for the organization or the mailbox) and the safelist collection on the mailbox. Users can enable or disable the junk email rule in their own mailbox by using Outlook on the web.
    
- **Configure the safelist collection**: The safelist collection is the Safe Senders list, the Safe Recipients list, and the Blocked Senders list. Users can configure the safelist collection on their own mailbox by using Microsoft Outlook or Outlook on the web.
    
Administrators can enable or disable the junk email rule, and configure the safelist collection on a mailbox by using the **Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration** cmdlet. For more information, see[Configure Exchange antispam settings on mailboxes](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/868d7fd8-e817-46ba-9b67-edf2f50b9494.aspx).
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt432940.aspx).
  
## Parameters
<a name="DetailedDescription"> </a>

|**Parameter**|**Required**|**Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Identity_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.MailboxIdParameter  <br/> | The _Identity_ parameter specifies the mailbox that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies the mailbox. <br/>  For example: <br/>  Name <br/>  Display name <br/>  Alias <br/>  Distinguished name (DN) <br/>  Canonical DN <br/> _\<domain name\>_\ _\<account name\>_ <br/>  Email address <br/>  GUID <br/> **LegacyExchangeDN** <br/> **SamAccountName** <br/>  User ID or user principal name (UPN) <br/>  You can use the wildcard character (\*) to identify multiple mailboxes. <br/> |
| _Credential_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.PSCredential  <br/> |The _Credential_ parameter specifies the user name and password that's used to run this command. Typically, you use this parameter in scripts or when you need to provide different credentials that have the required permissions. <br/> This parameter requires the creation and passing of a credential object. This credential object is created by using the **Get-Credential** cmdlet. For more information, see[Get-Credential](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=142122).  <br/> |
| _DomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Fqdn  <br/> |This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.  <br/> The _DomainController_ parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, `dc01.contoso.com`.  <br/> |
| _ReadFromDomainController_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter  <br/> |The _ReadFromDomainController_ switch specifies that information should be read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you run the command `Set-AdServerSettings -ViewEntireForest $true` to include all objects in the forest and you don't use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, it's possible that information will be read from a global catalog that has outdated information. When you use the _ReadFromDomainController_ switch, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. You don't have to specify a value with this switch. <br/> > [!NOTE]> By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your Exchange servers.           |
| _ResultSize_ <br/> |Optional  <br/> |Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Unlimited  <br/> |The _ResultSize_ parameter specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all requests that match the query, use `unlimited` for the value of this parameter. The default value is `1000`.  <br/> |
